Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

After conducting 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000 simulations, I did not observe any incorrect predictions. The results generated from each simulation were very similar, so the accuracy of the predicted outcomes did not change significantly as the number of simulations increased.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 100
